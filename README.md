Advent of Code 2023 - Turbo Pascal 3.01A under CP/M 2.2.

Some examples from Advent of Code 2023 written in Turbo Pascal 3.01A under CP/M 2.2

These require my Pascal Big Integer library - BIGILIB.PAS - which can
be found here: https://github.com/psychotimmy/PascalBigIntegers

As per the advent of code rules, the sample and puzzle data are not included in 
this repository. They are available here: https://adventofcode.com/2023

In turbo pascal, use the COM compilation option to create dayxx-y.com executables.

Benchmarks run on an RC2040 (a RC2014 emulator) with the version of BIGILIB.PAS
current at the time. Performance enhancements to this library are ongoing!

Day18-1.pas - runs in 3 minutes 17 seconds using the puzzle data.
